Hello World!
I'm a young man aspiring to work in the cybersecurity field.
The projects I upload are going to be simple python projects that I work on to get a better grasp on the language and automation of certain tasks.
Please feel free to edit my code with suggestions that would make my projects run smoother.
I would also like to learn other languages like bash so there might be some other projects of that language coming soon.
Thank you for taking the time to read about me :)
